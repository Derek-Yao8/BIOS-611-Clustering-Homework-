Clustering Homework

This is a BIOS 611 homework assignment which utilizes K-means clustering and spectral clustering to answer questions 
and perform tasks on a generated dataset. We will evaluate how these two techniques perform with structure and property changes in 
the data.

There are two tasks in the R script:
Task 1 generates data with specified clusters and creates datasets that move the clusters progressively closer. 
K-means clustering is then performed on the datasets.

Task 2 generates a dataset of concentric shells and performs spectral clustering on the dataset.
