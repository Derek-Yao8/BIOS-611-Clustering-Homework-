Task 1:
Interpretation: The simulation results show that the higher dimensions 
(true number of clusters) have a higher estimated number of clusters. 
It also seems that the gap statistic method is able to estimate the correct 
number of clusters for each dimension but then starts to estimate far lower 
clusters for all dimensions at side length 3.

It seems the gap statistic method consistently begins to reduce its estimate 
of the number of clusters at side length 3 for dimensions 3, 4, and 6. The gap 
statistic method consistently begins to reduce its estimate of the number of 
clusters at side length 2 for dimensions 2 and 5.


Task 2:
Based on the visualization of the estimated number of clusters with decreasing 
max shell radius, the algorithm never matched with the true number of clusters 
for all maximum shell radius from 10 to 0. The similarity graph was too sparse 
for large radii and/or too dense at small radii. Therefore, since our spectral 
clustering relied on the similarity graph, we never reached the true number of 
clusters of 4. The algorithm did estimate larger number of clusters at larger 
radii but then reached 1 very quickly afterwards. If we used a small 
d_threshold, the algorithm could possibly estimate a larger number of clusters 
or 4 clusters for smaller radii. If the d_threshold was larger, the drop below 
4 or failure point would happen at larger radii.
